// HASHER IMPLEMENTATION
// ================================================================================================

/// Implementation of the Rescue Prime Optimized hash function with 256-bit output.
///
/// The hash function is implemented according to the Rescue Prime Optimized
/// [specifications](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/1577) while the padding rule follows the one
/// described [here](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1045).
///
/// The parameters used to instantiate the function are:
/// * Field: 64-bit prime field with modulus p = 2^64 - 2^32 + 1.
/// * State width: 12 field elements.
/// * Rate size: r = 8 field elements.
/// * Capacity size: c = 4 field elements.
/// * Number of founds: 7.
/// * S-Box degree: 7.
///
/// The above parameters target a 128-bit security level. The digest consists of four field elements
/// and it can be serialized into 32 bytes (256 bits).
///
/// ## Hash output consistency
/// Functions [hash_elements()](Rpo256::hash_elements), [merge()](Rpo256::merge), and
/// [merge_with_int()](Rpo256::merge_with_int) are internally consistent. That is, computing
/// a hash for the same set of elements using these functions will always produce the same
/// result. For example, merging two digests using [merge()](Rpo256::merge) will produce the
/// same result as hashing 8 elements which make up these digests using
/// [hash_elements()](Rpo256::hash_elements) function.
///
/// However, [hash()](Rpo256::hash) function is not consistent with functions mentioned above.
/// For example, if we take two field elements, serialize them to bytes and hash them using
/// [hash()](Rpo256::hash), the result will differ from the result obtained by hashing these
/// elements directly using [hash_elements()](Rpo256::hash_elements) function. The reason for
/// this difference is that [hash()](Rpo256::hash) function needs to be able to handle
/// arbitrary binary strings, which may or may not encode valid field elements - and thus,
/// deserialization procedure used by this function is different from the procedure used to
/// deserialize valid field elements.
///
/// Thus, if the underlying data consists of valid field elements, it might make more sense
/// to deserialize them into field elements and then hash them using
/// [hash_elements()](Rpo256::hash_elements) function rather than hashing the serialized bytes
/// using [hash()](Rpo256::hash) function.
///
/// ## Domain separation
/// [merge_in_domain()](Rpo256::merge_in_domain) hashes two digests into one digest with some domain
/// identifier and the current implementation sets the second capacity element to the value of
/// this domain identifier. Using a similar argument to the one formulated for domain separation of
/// the RPX hash function in Appendix C of its [specification](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1045),
/// one sees that doing so degrades only pre-image resistance, from its initial bound of c.log_2(p),
/// by as much as the log_2 of the size of the domain identifier space. Since pre-image resistance
/// becomes the bottleneck for the security bound of the sponge in overwrite-mode only when it is
/// lower than 2^128, we see that the target 128-bit security level is maintained as long as
/// the size of the domain identifier space, including for padding, is less than 2^128.
///
/// ## Hashing of empty input
/// The current implementation hashes empty input to the zero digest [0, 0, 0, 0]. This has
/// the benefit of requiring no calls to the RPO permutation when hashing empty input.
