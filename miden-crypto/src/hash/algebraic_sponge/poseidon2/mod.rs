/// Implementation of the Poseidon2 hash function with 256-bit output.
///
/// The implementation follows the original [specification](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/323) and
/// its accompanying reference [implementation](https://github.com/HorizenLabs/poseidon2).
///
/// The parameters used to instantiate the function are:
/// * Field: 64-bit prime field with modulus 2^64 - 2^32 + 1.
/// * State width: 12 field elements.
/// * Capacity size: 4 field elements.
/// * S-Box degree: 7.
/// * Rounds: There are 2 different types of rounds, called internal and external, and are
///   structured as follows:
/// - Initial External rounds (IE): `add_constants` → `apply_sbox` → `apply_matmul_external`.
/// - Internal rounds: `add_constants` → `apply_sbox` → `apply_matmul_internal`, where the constant
///   addition and sbox application apply only to the first entry of the state.
/// - Terminal External rounds (TE): `add_constants` → `apply_sbox` → `apply_matmul_external`.
/// - An additional `apply_matmul_external` is inserted at the beginning in order to protect against
///   some recent attacks.
///
/// The above parameters target a 128-bit security level. The digest consists of four field elements
/// and it can be serialized into 32 bytes (256 bits).
///
/// ## Hash output consistency
/// Functions [hash_elements()](Poseidon2::hash_elements), [merge()](Poseidon2::merge), and
/// [merge_with_int()](Poseidon2::merge_with_int) are internally consistent. That is, computing
/// a hash for the same set of elements using these functions will always produce the same
/// result. For example, merging two digests using [merge()](Poseidon2::merge) will produce the
/// same result as hashing 8 elements which make up these digests using
/// [hash_elements()](Poseidon2::hash_elements) function.
///
/// However, [hash()](Poseidon2::hash) function is not consistent with functions mentioned above.
/// For example, if we take two field elements, serialize them to bytes and hash them using
/// [hash()](Poseidon2::hash), the result will differ from the result obtained by hashing these
/// elements directly using [hash_elements()](Poseidon2::hash_elements) function. The reason for
/// this difference is that [hash()](Poseidon2::hash) function needs to be able to handle
/// arbitrary binary strings, which may or may not encode valid field elements - and thus,
/// deserialization procedure used by this function is different from the procedure used to
/// deserialize valid field elements.
///
/// Thus, if the underlying data consists of valid field elements, it might make more sense
/// to deserialize them into field elements and then hash them using
/// [hash_elements()](Poseidon2::hash_elements) function rather than hashing the serialized bytes
/// using [hash()](Poseidon2::hash) function.
///
/// ## Domain separation
/// [merge_in_domain()](Poseidon2::merge_in_domain) hashes two digests into one digest with some
/// domain identifier and the current implementation sets the second capacity element to the value
/// of this domain identifier. Using a similar argument to the one formulated for domain separation
/// in Appendix C of the [specifications](https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/1045), one sees that doing
/// so degrades only pre-image resistance, from its initial bound of c.log_2(p), by as much as
/// the log_2 of the size of the domain identifier space. Since pre-image resistance becomes
/// the bottleneck for the security bound of the sponge in overwrite-mode only when it is
/// lower than 2^128, we see that the target 128-bit security level is maintained as long as
/// the size of the domain identifier space, including for padding, is less than 2^128.
///
/// ## Hashing of empty input
/// The current implementation hashes empty input to the zero digest [0, 0, 0, 0]. This has
/// the benefit of requiring no calls to the Poseidon2 permutation when hashing empty input.
