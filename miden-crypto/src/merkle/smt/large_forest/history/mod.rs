//! This module contains the definition of [`History`], a simple container for some number of
//! historical versions of a given merkle tree.
//!
//! This history consists of a series of _deltas_ from the current state of the tree, moving
//! backward in history away from that current state. These deltas are then used to form a "merged
//! overlay" that represents the changes to be made on top of the current tree to put it _back_ in
//! that historical state.
//!
//! It provides functionality for adding new states to the history, as well as for querying the
//! history at a given point in time.
//!
//! # Complexity
//!
//! Versions in this structure are _cumulative_. To get the entire picture of an arbitrary node or
//! leaf at version `v` it may be necessary to check for changes in all versions between `v` and the
//! current tree state. This gives worst-case complexity `O(v)` when querying a node or leaf for the
//! version `v`.
//!
//! This is acceptable overhead as we assert that newer versions are far more likely to be queried
//! than older versions. Nevertheless, it may be improved in future using a sharing approach, but
//! that potential improvement is being ignored for now for the sake of simplicity.
//!
//! # Performance
//!
//! This structure operates entirely in memory, and is hence reasonably quick to query. As of the
//! current time, no detailed benchmarking has taken place for the history, but based on some basic
//! profiling the major time taken is in chasing pointers throughout memory due to the use of
//! [`Map`]s, but this is unavoidable in the current structure and may need to be revisited in
//! the future.
