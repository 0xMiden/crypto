// BACKEND
// ================================================================================================

/// The backing storage for the SMT forest, providing the necessary high-level methods for
/// performing operations on the full trees that make up the forest, while allowing the forest
/// itself to be storage agnostic.
///
/// # Backend Data Storage
///
/// Having a generic [`Backend`] provides no guarantees to the user about how it stores data and
/// what patterns are used for data access under the hood. It is, however, guaranteed to store
/// _only_ the data necessary to describe the latest state of each tree in the forest.
///
/// # Error Handling
///
/// We separate errors in backend implementations into two semantic categories:
///
/// 1. **User-Derived Errors:** These are errors that arise downstream of data provided by the user.
///    These errors must be signaled by returning an [`Err`] variant with an appropriate error.
/// 2. **Internal Errors:** These are errors that are not derived from data provided by the user.
///    Signaling such an error is up to the implementation, but can be done through both panicking
///    and returning the [`BackendError::Internal`] variant as appropriate. These **may leave the
///    backend in an inconsistent state** as they are designed to effect program termination or
///    perform it directly.
///
/// The only reason that [`BackendError::Internal`] exists is to allow certain failures to result in
/// termination at the level of the _forest_ instead of the _backend_ as this can sometimes lead to
/// cleaner logic. If this is not appropriate, a panic is a better option.
///
/// # Expected Behavior
///
/// Certain methods on this trait (e.g. [`Backend::update_tree`]) provide behaviors expected for
/// that method. These combine with the following trait-level behavior requirements to become part
/// of the contract of the method, but a portion that cannot be encoded in the type system. Any
/// failure to conform to these expected behaviors is **considered a bug in the implementation** of
/// the backend, and must be rectified.
///
/// The following behavior is expected of all methods in implementations of this trait:
///
/// - For any failure derived from user input (see _User-Derived Errors_ above), the data and the
///   backend must be **left in a consistent state** when the error is returned to the caller.
/// - Failures derived from user input (see _User-Derived Errors_ above) must be signaled to the
///   caller by returning a variant of [`BackendError`] that is **not [`BackendError::Internal`]**.
///   Methods may place additional constraints on which errors are used to signal certain failures.
