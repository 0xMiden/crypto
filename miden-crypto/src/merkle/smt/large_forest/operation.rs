//! This module contains the definition of the [`ForestOperation`] type that encapsulates the
//! possible modifications made to a tree, as well as the concept of a [`SmtUpdateBatch`] of
//! operations to be performed on a single tree in the forest. This is then extended to
//! [`SmtForestUpdateBatch`], which defines a batch of operations across multiple trees.
