//! A deterministic RPO Falcon512 signature over a message.
//!
//! This version differs from the reference implementation in its use of the RPO algebraic hash
//! function in its hash-to-point algorithm.
//!
//! Another point of difference is the determinism in the signing process. The approach used to
//! achieve this is the one proposed in [1].
//! The main challenge in making the signing procedure deterministic is ensuring that the same
//! secret key is never used to produce two inequivalent signatures for the same `c`.
//! For a precise definition of equivalence of signatures see [1].
//! The reference implementation uses a random nonce per signature in order to make sure that,
//! with overwhelming probability, no two c-s will ever repeat and this non-repetition turns out
//! to be enough to make the security proof of the underlying construction go through in
//! the random-oracle model.
//!
//! Making the signing process deterministic means that we cannot rely on the above use of nonce
//! in the hash-to-point algorithm, i.e., the hash-to-point algorithm is deterministic. It also
//! means that we have to derandomize the trapdoor sampling process and use the entropy in
//! the secret key, together with the message, as the seed of a CPRNG. This is exactly the approach
//! taken in [2] but, as explained at length in [1], this is not enough. The reason for this
//! is that the sampling process during signature generation must be ensured to be consistent
//! across the entire computing stack i.e., hardware, compiler, OS, sampler implementations ...
//!
//! This is made even more difficult by the extensive use of floating-point arithmetic by
//! the sampler. In relation to this point, the current implementation does not use any platform
//! specific optimizations (e.g., AVX2, NEON, FMA ...) and relies solely on the builtin `f64` type.
//! Moreover, as per the time of this writing, the implementation does not use any methods or
//! functions from `std::f64` that have non-deterministic precision mentioned in their
//! documentation.
