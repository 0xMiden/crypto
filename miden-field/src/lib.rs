//! A unified `Felt` for Miden Rust code.
//!
//! This crate provides a single `Felt` type that can be used in both:
//! - On-chain (Wasm + `miden`): `Felt` is backed by a Miden VM felt via compiler intrinsics.
//! - Off-chain (native / non-Miden Wasm): `Felt` is backed by Plonky3's Goldilocks field element.
